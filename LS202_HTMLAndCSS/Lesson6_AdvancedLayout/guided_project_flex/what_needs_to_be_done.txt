# Tasks that need to be accomplished to make the website use a Flex approach
- define how the grid needs to be organized in terms of single rows
  (because this is Flex and not Grid)
- because the requirements state to not change the html, use the existing structure
  to convert containers to Flex containers
- get rid of any un-necessary styling and adjust to match the final look
  such as widths and heights
- validate css (again, cannot change HTML despite it not passing W3C validation)
