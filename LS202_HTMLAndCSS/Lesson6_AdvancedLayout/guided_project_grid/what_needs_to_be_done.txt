# What needs to be done to convert the project to CSS Grid
- zero margin and padding on all html element and remove
  un-necessary css margin and padding styling
- DRY up the stylesheet and have it correspond to the initial
  design
> initialize the grid on the parent element that contains:
    - the heading
    - horizontal navigation
    - row that contains aside-1, article-1, aside-2
    - row that contains aside-3, article-2
    - row that contains the image and copyright
      + get rid of the weird image margin

    # Designing the grid
    The design is 5 rows tall

      1] header    - single column
      2] nav       - 5      columns
      3] content 1 - 3      columns
      4] content 2 - 1      columns
      5] 2         - columns

    The plan is to create an initial grid and assign content to
    the cells, rows, regions etc.

- validate CSS
