# container
- min width of 500px
- max width of 1000px

# central photo
- full column width
- should be wrapped and captioned using a figure + figcaption
  here the default styling needs to be removed to take up the
  full width

# four thumbnails
- single row
- all take up the same percentage width whatever the size of the
  container
- use any technique you want like for example:
    - inline-block elements
    - float them + clearfix
    - I wont use flex or grid for now
