Given that the article element has properties:

  - box-sizing: border-box
  - display: inline-block

  article width  = 500 + 30 = 530
  article height = 300 + 30 = 330

Given that the div element has properties:

  - box-sizing: border-box
  - display: inline-block

  because the div has a 1 px wide border and that border is inset
  based on the display type, the div needs to be 2px larger to account
  for that.

  div width  = article width  + 2 = 530 + 2 = 532
  div height = article height + 2 = 330 + 2 = 332
