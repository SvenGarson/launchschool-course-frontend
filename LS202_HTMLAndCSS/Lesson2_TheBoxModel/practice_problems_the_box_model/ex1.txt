# What size the img takes based on it's attributes

  Because it is of box-sizing model 'content-box' it outsets the 
  padding and border and the margin. So the margin affects the div
  but is invisible.

  So the dimensions needed by the img element are:
    formula: size = axis dimension + all padding + all borders + all margin
    width = 500 + 40 + 8 + 30 = 578px
    height = 300 + 20 + 8 + 30 = 358px

  So the img element itself takes up (w, h) = (578px, 358px)

# What size the div needs to entirely contain the img element WITH
# the img margins?

  Here the logic is twisted and it is harder to apply the border-box
  model.

  I think the question asks for which exact minimum values the width
  and height properties of the div must be set to in order for the div
  to be able to contain the img pixel exact and have no extra space.

  Because the div uses the border-box box-sizing model and it has a
  border of 1px, this means that the available space in the div is:

    available space div = (
      div.width - 2, # because two borders horizontally
      div.height - 2 # because two borders vertically
    )

  Dimensions of the img element are: (538px, 368px)

  So in order for the div to have exactly enough space as to fit in
  the img element, the div must be of dimensions:

  asked div dimension = (
    img.width + 2 = 578px + 2px = 580px
    img.height + 2 = 358px + 2px = 360px
  )
