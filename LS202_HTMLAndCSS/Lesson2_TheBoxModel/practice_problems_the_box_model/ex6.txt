# Does the initial code display both article boxes side-by-side?

  - Default outer display type of article element is block.

  No.

# If not, why not?

  Because the two nested article elements do not display
  side-by-side because they are of outer display type block,
  which means that each of them takes a full line.

# How would you fix it so the boxes are display side-by-side?

  > What is the space available in the section element the nested
    elements have to fit into?

    content box ==> (w, h) = (900px, 400px)

  > considering the options to make the boxes fit

    - set outer display type of articles to inline-block, this means
      that the width and height attributes are regarded!

      The problem then here is that the total size of the articles
      boxes are, which are of default box model type content-box:
      section dimensions(w, h) = (
        900*0.5 + 2x10 px padding + 2x1px border = 472px,
        400*1.0 + 2x10 px padding + 2x1px border = 422px
      )

    The dimensions of both boxes is larger than what fits in the section
    so this does not work unless, the padding AND the border are set
    to zero.

    We can fix this problems by setting the nested elements to a box
    model type of content-border so that the padding and border ar
    inset the box rather than outset and because the margin is zero,
    there is enough room to fit both boxes side-by-side.

    - set outer display type of articles to inline, this means that the
      width and height are NOT regarded!

      The content size of the article element is not larger than 450px
      by 400px given this CSS and html, and actually should be pretty
      small given than the content is only the text 'content' and 
      'more content'.

      Since the content boxes here are so much smaller than the parent
      box, the padding and he border should not play a role here.

      So the simplest solution is to just set the visual display model
      to inline.
