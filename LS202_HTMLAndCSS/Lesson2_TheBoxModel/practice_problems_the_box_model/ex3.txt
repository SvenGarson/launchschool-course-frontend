First determine the actual dimensions of the em element.

em element is of box sizing model 'content-box'.

em_dimensions_with_margins(in pixels) = (
  (500 + 40 + 8 + 30) = 578,
  (300 + 20 + 8 + 30) = 358
)

Again the parent div is of box-sizing model 'border-box' which
insets the border inside (only border because this div has padding
and margin of zero) which means that the div needs to be twice the
border larger on the size axis in order to fit the em block.

The answer is = (
  (578 + 2) = 580,
  (358 + 2) = 360
)

At this point I'm sure there is something else to the answer though
that I missed.

My solutiono was completely wrong, here is my understanding of the
solution in bullet points:

  - The em element is of display model 'inline' which means that
    the browser ignores the following elements' css properties even
    if defined:
      *width
      *height
      *top margin
      *bottom margin

  - This means that we can compute using the formulas defined by the
    box sizing model, which in this case is 'content-box' for em
    elements but IGNORE the properties that are ignore based on the
    display model.

  - The final computations are done using the same formula with the
    follwing constraints:

      - the actual content of the element is used as width/height
        and NOT the css width and height properties
      - the elements top and bottom margin are ignored

  - Let me do the computations with the hypothetical content size of
    the em elements being (50px, 20px)

    em dimensions(in pixels) = (
      (50 + 40 + 8 + 30(do not ignore horizontal margin)) = 128,
      (20 + 20 + 8 + 0 (do     ignore vertical   margin)) = 48
    )

    And because we need to account for the div being of box-sizing model
    'border' being inset for the 1 pixel border which means that the div
    needs to be 2 pixels larger per axis than it's content in order to
    fully contain that content, the div size must be

    div_size = (
      (em_dimensions.width + 2) = 130,
      (em_dimensions.height + 2) = 50
    )
