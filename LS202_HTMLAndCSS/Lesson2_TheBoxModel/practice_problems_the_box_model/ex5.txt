1) NO Because the block display formatting model makes each box :
    - take up the complete line
    - flow to the next line

2) Yes they are displayed side by side because:
    - the parent div has enough width 720 for these elements
    - the outer display type of inline causes the nested elements
      to NOT flow to next line and only takes up as much space
      as the content takes, which should be way less than 360px
      per box.

      The width and heigh attributes of the nested boxes are
      ignored though because of the outer display type: inline

3) Yes they are displayed side by side because:
    - the outer display type of inline-block:
        - does not wrap elements to the next line
        - takes the width and height defined by the attributes
    - the nested elements fit exactly in the the div's content region
      of 720px width because:
        - the div is of box model type content-box, which means the
          padding, border and margin outset the box from the width
          and height, so the content size is 720px wide.
        - the nested elements are of box model type border-box, which
          means that when their dimensions are regarded, like for this
          case with the outer display type of inline-block, their
          dimensions of size+padding+border is a total of 360px width
          and 240px height given that the margin is zero

4) No because the one element with box-model type box takes up
   one whole line for itself.

5) NO because again, the box-model type box element will take up
   a whole line itself.

6) Let's walk through the scenario:

    > say the first element is of outer display type inline
        - does not wrap to new line
        - takes only as much room as it's content need because
          width and height attributes are disregarded
        - it's content should fit easily in the 360px width it can
          have
        - box model type is still border-box, and with a margin an
          of padding of zero, and no border, this does not change
          anything.
    > say the second element is of outer display type inline-block
        - does not wrap to a new line either
        - takes the exact width and height defined, which is one of
          the points it differs from the outer display type inline.

          So because the box model type is border-box, margin, padding
          and border are zero, this element will take up exactly
          360px width by 240px height.

          Which fits into the parent.

    Conclusion: Yes they flow side-by-side on the same line
