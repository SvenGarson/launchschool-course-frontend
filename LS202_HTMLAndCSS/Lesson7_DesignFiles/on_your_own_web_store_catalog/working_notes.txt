# The markup

> Header
    - H1: Paramiicio + that contains a link to index.html

> Main
    - H2: All products
    > Items grid as unordered list:
        # every item ...
        # but this incorporates the label/checkbox trick !!!
        # so add that as soon as I understand it
        Figure: the figurine image
          Figcaption: The figurine name
        P: Figurine price


    > Unordered List:
        - contains cells where each cell is 23.5% wide
          and the computed height is about 235.477px
        - the image and the figurine name are associated through
          a figure and figcaption
        - contains a price for every entry, this can be a plain paragraph

> Footer
    - Seemingly empty
    - Or do not specify at all

> Containers and other info
    - header and main contained in container that is 900px wide
    - products grid as 25px padding all around so it ends up
      being 850px wide

> Functionality and trick
    - Clicking on the image maximizes the images and occludes the background
      and clicking anywhere on the page resets to normal
    - when an image is maximized, the image is not shown in the grid anymore

> To think of:
    - reset all that is needed
    - specify fonts and Box-Model
    - specify colors, root and other font-sizes
