### The purpose of CSS resets and some options to choose from

---

A CSS reset overrides specific default browser styling, so that most cross-browser problems, terms of styling go away and we can work from a fresh slate without playing cat and mouse between browsers.



There are many CSS resets. Here are some simple ones:

### Using design files to extract the needed requirements and data

**Accumulated notes**:

- always choose the most purposeful image type
- anything used as source in an `image` tag is prefixed with `img_some_image.jpg`, this communicates that the image is probably used as content
- CSS can include CSS tiles using the `@import` thing which is **great for CSS resets**
- fonts can be used for a web application by linking it as resource through a URL such as for example Google fonts
