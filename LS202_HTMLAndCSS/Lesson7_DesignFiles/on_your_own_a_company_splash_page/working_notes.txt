# semantic markup and structure
  - white box is the main that contains subheading and text paras
  - gray box is the footer that contains the anchors to other origins

# the font
  - default font weight: medium
  - both main headings : heavy
  - blue subheadings   : black

# other
  - user empty on page links for the social media links
  - use &bull; for the bullet point content

# when done
- validate everything
- compare to the reference site: https://d3jtzah944tvom.cloudfront.net/202/projects/lesson_7/company_splash_page_final/site.html
- check syntax and spacing as well as /> closing auto-closing tags

# notes about me approach and thinking
- using one h1 and one h2 but setting them the same size
  to semantically use the h1 and h2 and NOT for styling
