  Questions to base the code review on, maybe:
    ? Usage of rem ok here despite the precision of the decimals
    ? am I right about trying to use mostly rem units and not inject
      any absolute px values? both seems to have advantages and disa
      dvantages off course but at the time I don't see
      the effects everything has on each other so I recon there must
      be some obvious tips the TA can give me?
    ? am I right that good semantic class names are a better way
      to layout HTML rather than just using all sorts of selectors?

      It seems more intuitive to me to use classes and id's if the
      names mean something intuitive like for example central-photo
      instead of class="bordered edged".
    ! no need to focus oon import thing since I will do some research later
    ! small vertical positioning and box shadow descrepencancy
