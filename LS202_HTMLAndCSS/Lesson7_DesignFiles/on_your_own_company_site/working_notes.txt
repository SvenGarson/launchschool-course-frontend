  Todo:
    - sort CSS properties by 
    - reset the elements margin/padding that are used
    - check that the background image works same as the reference
    - do we need to styke a:link; a: visited etc manually?;
      - :link is every unvisited a element
      - :visited is a link the user already visited
    - make sure the html document title are correct
    - test that the pages are corectly linked together
      and state changes in nav work
    - test that shared style works between pages
    - use css import instead of links redundantly
    - section for the main contents?
    - the example site company logo is a link to home!
    - the example font characters seems to be narrower
      about 2 pixels or so
    - used h3 for the subheading under about us because it could be
      anything like a slogan
    - could add a section/article for the projects maybe!

  Decisions for HTML semantics
    - div of class main-content to create column that
      takes up 1000px to avoid specifying a different
      width for different main content areas.
    - the line-spacing -0.1px trick is dirty
    - either use px or rem for margin and padding,
      not both!

        - check color
        - check bg-color
        - check font size

  Feedback related:
    - chose to split the font family, size and weight to be
      less verbose
    - chose section for the main content
      since the content is not necessarily
      self-contained in my opinion but rather
      depends on the surrounding context 
      and even pages
    - numbers are odd I just took the closest and left them as is
    - if selectors were 2-3 qualifiers long I just took them
      as I defined them in the hierarchyy?
    - used a few classes to decouple the HTML from the CSS so that
      changing the order of container HTML elements does not change
      the styling based on selectors like nth-of-type for instance
    - no reset this time to see how annoying it is + my experience
      that I have to actually reset everything by hand and think of
      it
