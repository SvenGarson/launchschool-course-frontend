  Todo:
    > specify:
        - the correct foreground and background color
        - the correct font-weight
    - reset the elements margin/padding that are used
    - check that the background image works same as the reference
    - do we need to styke a:link; a: visited etc manually?;
      - :link is every unvisited a element
      - :visited is a link the user already visited
    - make sure the html document title are correct
    - test that the pages are corectly linked together
      and state changes in nav work
    - test that shared style works between pages
    - use css import instead of links redundantly
    - section for the main contents?
    - the example site company logo is a link to home!
    - the example font characters seems to be narrower
      about 2 pixels or so

  Decisions for HTML semantics
    - div of class main-content to create column that
      takes up 1000px to avoid specifying a different
      width for different main content areas.
    - the line-spacing -0.1px trick is dirty
    - either use px or rem for margin and padding,
      not both!
