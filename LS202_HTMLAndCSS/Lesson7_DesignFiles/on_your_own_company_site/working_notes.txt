  Todo:
    > specify:
        - the correct fonts for every element and install the 
          free font version
        - the correct foreground and background color
        - the correct font-weight
    - reset the elements margin/padding that are used
    - check that the background image works same as the reference
    - do we need to styke a:link; a: visited etc manually?;
      - :link is every unvisited a element
      - :visited is a link the user already visited
    - make sure the html document title are correct
    - test that the pages are corectly linked together
      and state changes in nav work
    - test that shared style works between pages
    - use css import instead of links redundantly
