Which one of the following tags are semantic and which are not?

Semantic tags:
  - article
  - aside
  - footer
  - h3
  - header
  - section

Other tags:
  - b
  - div
  - span
  - strong


Correction: All elements excepts div and span are semantic.

So it turns out the only HTML5 elements that do not have semantics
are div and span!
