The following are valid keys for a JS object:

 - '1'
 - 'hello world'
 - 'true'

In other words, only strings are valid keys.

  Turns out I am both right and wrong. While JS Object keys must
  be strings, JS also implicitly coerces non-string values into
  strings before setting the key-value pair.
