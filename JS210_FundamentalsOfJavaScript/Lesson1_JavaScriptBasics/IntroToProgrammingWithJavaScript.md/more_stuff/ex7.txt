Exception handling is a mechanism ins JS that enables us to attempt
to handle an error gracefully, occurs before the program
crashes or stops execution by executing another piece of code that
we designate to run in case an exception occurs for the portion of
code we mark as such.

Exceptions solve the problem of the program just crashing and not
giving us a chance to do something about it and keep the program
running.
