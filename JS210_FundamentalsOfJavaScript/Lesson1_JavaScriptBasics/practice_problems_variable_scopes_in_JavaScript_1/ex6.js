    Explain what the program outputs:

      line 1: undefined


    Explain how the relevant parts of the program work:

      At global scope 'var' add the 'a' property to teÄ¥e
      global or window object.

      Because of of hoisting, the 'a' variable is initialized
      with the value 'undefined' up to and excluding where the
      variable is defined/initialized.

      Since the console.log accesses the 'a' variable before it
      is re-assigned to another value, the output it 'undefined'
