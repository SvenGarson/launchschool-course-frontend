### JavaScript Versions

---

JavaScript's official name is `ECMAScript` and is commonly abbreviated as `ES`.

JS/ES versions are often abbreviated using either:

- The release year, like for example `ECMAScript 2019` or `ES2019`
- The number of the version like for example `ECMAScript 10` or `ES10`



The version`ES6+` is considered `modern JS` because many improvements have been made starting at that version, but since many code bases still use older JS, also referred to as `traditional ES/JS` that was in use around `2005`, **we should know both for some time to come**.

Most modern browsers support ES6+ features well but older browsers do not, so when the compatibility is questionable:

- Use a [Compatibility Table](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus) to determine if the feature is supported
- Use a transpilation tool like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to automatically mutate scripts into code that used only features for a particular environment



### How I am approaching this course

---


**The list of files I intend to use as notes in different contexts:**

- questions and answers per lesson and per notes: Once for the notes and once explicitly as another file for later?
- generality notes to keep track of stuff that does not fit anywhere else and for later reference



**The current plan**:

1. The JS introduction book is done in terms of rough notes
2. Finish the course and make notes, do not do much research here
3. Merge the JS intro and course notes and do the research there
4. Make Flashcards when notes are good



#### Code Style

---

- Make flashcards to get the [naming conventions](https://launchschool.com/lessons/7377ece4/assignments/88ed1c52) into my head



### Data Types

---

#### Primitive Data Types

- `Number`
- `Boolean`
- `String`  -  Can hold any UTF-16 Character
- `null`
- `undefined`
- `symbol` (ES6)
- `BigInt` (ES9)



#### Compound Data Type

- `Object`



### Variables

---

#### Assignment and Initializer

A variable can be declared two ways:

1. `Declare` a variable first and then `assign` a value in a separate statement.

   The default value of an un-initialized variable is `undefined`.

2. `Declare` a variable with an `initializer` on the same line.


While assignment and initialization look look identical, they are distinct in terminology:

- `Assignment` is a standalone expression that gives a variable a new value
- An `initializer` is an expression to the right of an `=` in a `variable declaration`



#### Declaring Variables

- `var` is the traditional way to declare variables
- use only `let` and `const` unless you work in an old a traditional environment



#### Dynamic Typing

JS/EC is a dynamically typed language which means that a variable can point to any data type.



### Expressions and Statements

---

#### Expressions

Any valid code that resolves to a value is an `expression` and can anywhere JS expects/allows a value.

**Examples of expressions:**

- lonely string `'Humpty Dumpty'`
- arithmetic operation `15 + 28`
- assignment `sum = 95`

#### Statements  -  ???





#### Various bits of information

---

- JS uses Floating Point to represents all numbers

- `\` at the end of a line forces JS to ignore the new line, this is great to chain long strings together.
  But beware the spaces because JS treats each space/tab etc as an actual space/tab in the string

  - The verbose version

    ```javascript
    let longText = 'esfesvsfawesvef ef sev es esfse es\n' +
                   'esfesf ef sef osjefn sief iosnevion';
    ```

  - The less verbose and less flexible version

    ```javascript
    let longText = 'awdd awca cesesfsefs es se\n\
    dawd  awdwdwad wad wa dwa\n\
    dwawd wf ffesfes skf sef';
    ```
