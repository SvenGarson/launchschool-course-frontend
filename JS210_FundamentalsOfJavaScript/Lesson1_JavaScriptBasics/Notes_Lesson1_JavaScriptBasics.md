### JavaScript Versions

---

JavaScript's official name is `ECMAScript` and is commonly abbreviated as `ES`.

JS/ES versions are often abbreviated using either:

- The release year, like for example `ECMAScript 2019` or `ES2019`
- The number of the version like for example `ECMAScript 10` or `ES10`



The version`ES6+` is considered `modern JS` because many improvements have been made starting at that version, but since many code bases still use older JS, also referred to as `traditional ES/JS` that was in use around `2005`, **we should know both for some time to come**.

Most modern browsers support ES6+ features well but older browsers do not, so when the compatibility is questionable:

- Use a [Compatibility Table](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus) to determine if the feature is supported
- Use a transpilation tool like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to automatically mutate scripts into code that used only features for a particular environment
