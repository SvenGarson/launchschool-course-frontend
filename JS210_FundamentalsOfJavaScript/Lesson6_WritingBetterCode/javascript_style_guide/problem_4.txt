# How does the following code violate the Airbnb style guide?
if (finishedBook())
  console.log('You have finished reading this book');


The conditional should be on one line with the branch if not
curly braces are used, but should always use curly braces for
multi-line conditionals.

# single-line conditional
if (finishedBook())console.log('You have finished reading this book');

# multi-line conditional
if (finishedBook()) {
  console.log('You have finished reading this book');}
}
