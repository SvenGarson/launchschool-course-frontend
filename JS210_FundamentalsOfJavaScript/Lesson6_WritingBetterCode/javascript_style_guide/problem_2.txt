# How does the following code violalate the Airbnb JS
# style guide?

let title = 'The Three-Body Problem',
    author = 'Cixin Liu',
    page_count = 400;

Every variable declaration should use it's own 'let' keyword
and not a single one to declare three variables.

I missed the snake_case identifier. ES variables should use
camelCase and not snake_case.
