Given the HTML from question 2, would it be appropriate to replace <sometag> with <address>
or <blockquote>? If so, which one?

The address element is definitely not appropriate since it's semantics are about representing
contact information.

The blockquote however could be an appropriate element to represent the content in the html
given in problem 2) if the original were a section, wich given exercise number 2) could be
an appropriate choice, and it would then be quoted from another source using the blockquote's
'cite' attribute.
